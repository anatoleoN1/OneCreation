# OneCreation
a minecraft like with node.js on your browser

for windows users, you just have to import the zip, extract all into a folder (OneCreation) and clic on "start.bat" you will have a message he said "OneCreation launched on localhost://(port)"

for MacOS or Linux users, that more difficult. export the zip and extract them into your folder (if you are on linux, you need to extract into the linux folder) and open the terminal an type this:
```bash
cd [your folder]
chmod +x start.sh # for execution authorisation
./start.sh
```
